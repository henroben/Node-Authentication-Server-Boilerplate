Authentication Server
=============================
This is a stand alone server-side authentication server written in Node.JS. To see how this works with a client side example, see the [React/Redux Client App](https://github.com/henroben/React-Redux-Authentication-Client).

Setup
---
1. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) and get it running using `mongod.exe` or `mongod` through terminal/CMD (in the relevant folder if it's not install globally).
2. Place a random string into the `secret` string variable inside `config.js`.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. 

Start
---
1. Start MongoDB: `mongod` or `mongod.exe`.
2. Start server `npm start`.
3. Start in dev mode: `npm run dev`.
